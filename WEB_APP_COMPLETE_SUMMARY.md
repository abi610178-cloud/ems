## 🔄 React Native Conversion Requirements

### **What Needs to Change:**

1. **Routing**
   - ❌ `react-router-dom` (web-only)
   - ✅ `@react-navigation/native` (React Native)
   - Convert `<Route>` to `<Stack.Screen>`
   - Replace `<Link>` with `navigation.navigate()`

2. **Styling**
   - ❌ TailwindCSS classes (web-only)
   - ✅ React Native `StyleSheet` or styled-components
   - Convert `className` to `style` prop
   - Rebuild all layouts with `View`, `Text`, `ScrollView`

3. **Components**
   - ❌ HTML elements (`<div>`, `<button>`, `<input>`)
   - ✅ React Native components:
     - `<View>` instead of `<div>`
     - `<Text>` instead of `<span>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`
     - `<TextInput>` instead of `<input>`
     - `<TouchableOpacity>` or `<Pressable>` instead of `<button>`
     - `<Image>` instead of `<img>`

5. **Storage**
   - ❌ `localStorage` (web-only)
   - ✅ `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
   - Convert all localStorage calls to AsyncStorage

6. **Forms**
   - ❌ HTML form elements
   - ✅ React Native form libraries:
     - `react-native-paper`
     - `react-hook-form` (works with RN)
     - Custom form components

7. **Tables**
   - ❌ HTML `<table>` elements
   - ✅ `FlatList` or `SectionList` with custom row components

8. **Charts**
   - ❌ Web-based chart libraries
   - ✅ `react-native-chart-kit` or `victory-native`

9. **Navigation**
   - ❌ Browser navigation
   - ✅ Stack Navigator + Drawer Navigator + Tab Navigator

10. **Authentication**
    - Keep: Auth logic, context, state management
    - Change: Storage from localStorage to AsyncStorage
    - Add: Biometric authentication (optional)

## 📋 Component Mapping (Web → React Native)

### **Layout Components:**
| Web Component | React Native Equivalent |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `<div>` | `<View>` |
| `<span>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` | `<Text>` |
| `<button>` | `<TouchableOpacity>` or `<Pressable>` |
| `<input>` | `<TextInput>` |
| `<img>` | `<Image>` |
| `<table>` | `<FlatList>` with custom rows |
| Scrolling divs | `<ScrollView>` |

### **Navigation:**
| Web | React Native |
|-----|-------------|
| `react-router-dom` | `@react-navigation/native` |
| `<Route>` | `<Stack.Screen>` |
| `<Link>` | `navigation.navigate()` |
| `useNavigate()` | `useNavigation()` |

### **Styling:**
| Web | React Native |
|-----|-------------|
| Tailwind classes | StyleSheet.create() |
| CSS flexbox | flexDirection, justifyContent, etc. |
| Hover states | onPressIn/onPressOut |
| Media queries | Dimensions API + conditional rendering |

---

## 🗂️ Key Pages to Convert

### Priority Order:
1. **Login** → Simple form, good starting point
2. **Dashboard** → Complex layout, multiple components
3. **Employees List** → FlatList practice
4. **Employee Form** → Form handling
5. **Departments** → Similar to Employees
6. **Leave Management** → Date pickers, status management
7. **Task Management** → Interactive lists
8. **Attendance** → Geolocation integration
9. **Settings** → Various controls

---

## 🔌 Backend Integration (Supabase)

### **Current Setup:**
- Supabase client configured
- Connection URL and keys in .env
- Database migrations created for:
  - Users table
  - Tasks table
  - Notifications table

### **For React Native:**
- Same Supabase client works!
- Just install: `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Use environment variables or config file
- All API calls remain the same

## 💡 Conversion Tips

### **1. Start Simple**
- Begin with Login page (simple form)
- Test authentication flow
- Then move to Dashboard

### **2. Reuse Logic**
- Keep all context providers
- Keep service/API functions
- Keep TypeScript interfaces
- Keep business logic

### **3. New UI Components**
- Create reusable React Native components
- Build component library first
- Match web app's design language

### **4. Handle Differences**
- No hover states on mobile (use press states)
- Consider screen sizes
- Use native features (camera, GPS, biometrics)
- Optimize for touch interactions

### **5. Testing**
- Test on both iOS and Android
- Use emulators/simulators first
- Then test on real devices
- Handle platform-specific code with `Platform.OS`
