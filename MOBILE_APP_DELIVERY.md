## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Push Notifications
Your app can send and receive push notifications for:
- Task assignments
- Leave approvals
- Attendance reminders
- System alerts

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import NotificationService from './services/NotificationService';

NotificationService.showTaskNotification(
  'New Task',
  'Complete monthly report',
  'task-123'
);
```

### 2. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
Connect to wearable devices like Sense O'clock:
- Scan for nearby devices
- Connect and pair
- Read sensor data
- Send commands

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import BLEService from './services/BLEService';

await BLEService.startScan();
const devices = await BLEService.getDiscoveredDevices();
await BLEService.connectToDevice(deviceId);
```

### 3. Deep Linking
Open specific pages in your app:
- `employeeapp://open` - Open main page
- `employeeapp://open?page=dashboard` - Open dashboard
- `employeeapp://open?taskId=123` - Open specific task

**Test on Android:**
```bash
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW \
  -d "employeeapp://open?page=dashboard" \
  com.employeemanagementmobile
```

### 4. Offline Support
Your app works offline with cached content:
- Service Worker caches critical assets
- Previously loaded pages accessible offline
- Automatic sync when connection restored

### 5. Camera & File Uploads
Users can:
- Take photos with device camera
- Upload files from device storage
- Access photo library
- All with proper permissions
